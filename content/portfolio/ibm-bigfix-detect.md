journey: |-
  I worked on this project for 15 months.
  During my time there I learned much about working in an agile, global, co-located team.
  I spent much of my time grooming stories, planning the work, creating documents outlining my work, developing the features, testing the features, code reviewing, helping others reach their goals, and killing bugs.
  I learned a lot about front-end web development, testing (karma, jasmine, & selenium), and planning/grooming.
