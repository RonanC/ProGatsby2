  The goal of this site was to create a sleek, professional, and clean looking website to show case Rebecca's skills in writing, digital marketing / SEO, and voice work.
  I started with a basic theme and heavily customized it to her needs.
  I came up with an elegant color scheme and set of fonts.
  Custom stylings and PHP functions were needed to get the website looking as we wanted, and for the blog & portfolio sections to look customized to our liking.
