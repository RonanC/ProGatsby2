goal: |-
  The goal of this project was to create a cross platform mobile application to allow customers to pre-order from the catering company.<br>
  The app included a top-up system, and a way to customize sandwich orders.<br>
  Opening times, images, and order information was also available in the application.<br>
  Push notifications was set up to allow the catering company to alert their customers of deals.
whatidid: |-
  I worked on this project with two others (one backend developer, and a customer liaison).<br>
  We met with our client on a by-weekly basis, showing our progress and wire-frames, making sure they were happy and allowing for changes as we progressed (We followed the agile process).<br>
  We tested out a couple of options (JQuery Mobile, Native, and Ionic to name a few), but in the end found Ionic to be the the quickest to develop with and which gave the best looking design.<br>
  This was a part time project and took around 15 months to complete.<br>
  The customer was extremely happy with the process and the end result.
