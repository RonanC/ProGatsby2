goals: |-
  The goal of this project was to create a cross platform mobile application to allow customers to pre-order from the catering company.
  The app included a top-up system, and a way to customize sandwich orders.
  Opening times, images, and order information was also available in the application.
  Push notifications was set up to allow the catering company to alert their customers of deals.
journey: |-
  I worked on this project with two others (one backend developer, and a customer liaison).
  We met with our client on a by-weekly basis, showing our progress and wire-frames, making sure they were happy and allowing for changes as we progressed (We followed the agile process).
  We tested out a couple of options (JQuery Mobile, Native, and Ionic to name a few), but in the end found Ionic to be the the quickest to develop with and which gave the best looking design.
  This was a part time project and took around 15 months to complete.
  The customer was extremely happy with the process and the end result.
