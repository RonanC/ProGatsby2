gatsby serve
```

The site is now running at: `http://localhost:9000`

## üí´ How to deploy (Netlify)

```sh
npx netlify deploy
```

## ‚úèÔ∏è Netlify CMS setup

- Turn on Identity here:
  https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOURSITENAME/identity

- Make registration invite only:
  https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOURSITENAME/settings/identity#registration-preferences

- Invite yourself, create an account, and login via your site `/admin/`

**If you get an error when you land on the admin page it may be because you edited your project settings:**
To fix this reset the project link and the git-gateway in the below two places.

1. https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOURSITENAME/settings/deploys#build-settings
2. https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOURSITENAME/settings/identity#services

Make sure that you you're using `git-gateway` in your `config.yml` file:

```yml
backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: master
```

**Notes:**

- The gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms takes care of the hooking up on our side so you can ignore that in the doc above.
- Everything in the created static folder will get compoed into the output.

# Google Analytics

I'm using the `gatsby-plugin-google-analytics` to take care of the config, but here's what google analytics generated for me below.
The plugin will generate something similar:
https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-google-analytics/#create-only-fields

## Global Site Tag (gtag.js)

This is the Global Site Tag (gtag.js) tracking code for this property. Copy and paste this code as the first item into the <HEAD> of every web page that you want to track. If you already have a Global Site Tag on your page, simply add the config line from the snippet below to your existing Global Site Tag.

```html
<!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics -->
<script
  async
  src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-134235296-1"
></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []
  function gtag() {
    dataLayer.push(arguments)
  }
  gtag('js', new Date())

  gtag('config', 'UA-134235296-1')
</script>
```

# Mailchimp

You can create your own database of users by using Mailchimp.
The `gatsby-plugin-mailchimp` allows you to easily add in this sign up functionality.
Great for letting your followers know about new blog posts!
