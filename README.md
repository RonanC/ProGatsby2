## ‚úèÔ∏è Netlify CMS setup

- Turn on Identity here:
  https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-agnesi-43a1cd/identity

- Make registration invite only:
  https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-agnesi-43a1cd/settings/identity#registration-preferences

- Invite yourself, create an account, and login via your site `/admin/`

**If you get an error when you land on the admin page it may be because you edited your project settings:**
To fix this reset the project link and the git-gateway in the below two places.

1. https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-agnesi-43a1cd/settings/deploys#build-settings
2. https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-agnesi-43a1cd/settings/identity#services

Make sure that you you're using `git-gateway` in your `config.yml` file:

```yml
backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: master
```

**Notes:**

- The gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms takes care of the hooking up on our side so you can ignore that in the doc above.
- Everything in the created static folder will get compoed into the output.
