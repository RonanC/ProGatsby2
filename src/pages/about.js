        <p>
          From a very young age I've had a keen interest in technology, business
          and finance. Indeed my whole family is interested in these things, so
          I gained the interest through osmosis.
          <br />
          The West of Ireland is where I was born and raised. I now reside in
          Galway City on the west coast.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in doing whatever you want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone
          else (a motto I learned from the amazing writer{' '}

          <br />
          Some of my over arching goals in life are to become a leader in the
          Front-End development community, become a digital nomad (work while
          travelling), start my own business (leveraging modern technologies),
          and to become financially intelligent.

          In my spare time I enjoy reading, playing board-games, trekking,
          jogging, and learning (technology, business, and finance mostly). I'm
          a coffee connoisseur and really enjoy unwinding in a relaxed
          environment when I get some down time.

          `In September of 2018 I joined Fidelity Investments as a Senior Software Engineer (Contractor).
          This was a step up from my previous role. I had a few weeks off before starting.
          During this time I researched vanilla JS at a deep level, upgraded my software architecture skills, and learned the Angular framework.
          This paid dividends as I quickly became comfortable in my new role.

          When I first arrived at Fidelity I was taken aback by the high quality of the building, people, and technologies.
          I was put to work on implementing features for an investment web application using the Angular framework.

          This role at Fidelity was exactly what I was looking for, and I was over the moon to get a role in the finance industry as this has always been a goal of mine.

        Resilient was a recent startup that IBM had acquired, most of the team were based in Boston, USA.
        This was a really interesting role as I got to see how IBM handled merging a high performing startup into the corporate structure of the main company body.

        In this role I trained up the QA on the Galway side on test automation (selenium & groovy) so that they could write up the tests (most of the QA had never done any programming).
        I got to take my hand to the back-end and write up some features with Java & BASH.
        One feature in particular that I spent a lot of time on was audit logging (utilising Splunk).

        I joined the Sports & Social committee this year, which was incredibly fun and unwittingly a lot of hard work.
        I really enjoyed this as I got to organise events for all the amazing people at the IBM Galway office.

          I was ecstatic, as I'd always wanted to work as a software engineer for a big multi-national;
          IBM in particular stood out to me as it's such an historic company.

          Here I worked on creating features for a security web application which helped monitor malware attacks against endpoints.
          I was mainly working with AngularJS & Node.js.
          IBM is where I really found my feet in terms of Agile ceremonies, working in remote global co-located teams, and seeing how a multi-national works (the pros and cons).
          I really enjoyed learning the security domain. I learned all about the ins and outs of malware and just how fragile the whole worlds infrastructure is due to this malware.`
